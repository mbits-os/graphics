h2. About


Graphics is an Android binding for the @gfx@[1] library. It started as a replacement for the @android.graphics.Movie@[2] and has similar API, but tries to address certian issues the GIF decoder used by skia has.

h2. Requirements

Graphics needs @gfx@, obviously, but also @jini@[3] for the C++ JNI bindings. For building an Android library, you'll need Android developement environment. This includes:

# "Android SDK":http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
# "Android NDK":http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
# One of:
#* Eclipse with ADT, or
#* Maven

h2. Building

For succesfull build, you'll need working environment, as described on [Android](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html "Android SDK") pages.

First make a common directory for the repos:

bc. $ mkdir Graphics
$ cd Graphics

Clone the repositories:

bc. $ git clone git://github.com/mbits-os/jini.git
$ git clone git://github.com/mbits-os/gfx.git
$ git clone git://github.com/mbits-os/graphics.git

*TODO*: _Eclipse/Maven instructions_
