About
=====

Graphics is an Android binding for the `gfx` ([see](/mbit-os/gfx)) library.
It started as a replacement for the `android.graphics.Movie` and has
similar API.

Requirements
============

Graphics needs `gfx`, obviously, but also `jini` ([see](/mbits-os/jini))
for the C++ JNI bindings.

Building
========

It's always recommended to use the latest version from GitHub.

First make a common directory for the repos:

    $ mkdir Graphics
    $ cd Graphics

Clone the repositories:

    $ git clone git://github.com/mbits-os/jini.git
    $ git clone git://github.com/mbits-os/gfx.git
    $ git clone git://github.com/mbits-os/graphics.git

**TODO**: *Eclipse/Maven instructions*
